            <p class="mv-txt">The project focuses on  the Gaddi wool craft cluster in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh, using documentary filmmaking to explore its roots, purpose, and contemporary relevance. It combines research-driven inquiry with visual storytelling, aiming to uncover the cultural significance of the craft and its evolving role in modern times. The brief calls for a film that not only documents the tradition but also reflects on its impact and adaptation in today’s world. <br>

            <h2 class="proj-heading">Concept Note</h2>
            <p class="mv-txt">The documentary explores the revival of Gaddi wool, a traditional craft from Nagar, Himachal Pradesh, known for its authenticity, sustainability, and cultural significance. Once on the decline, it is now gaining recognition through select brands that uphold its quality and heritage. The film highlights its thermal adaptability, government support, and economic impact, while addressing the challenge of synthetic imitations that mislead consumers. Positioned as both a necessity and a desire, Gaddi wool aligns with the growing demand for story-driven, meaningful clothing, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials. <br><br>
                As Director & Editor-in-Chief, my vision was to craft a raw, emotionally compelling narrative, balancing aesthetic storytelling with authenticity. The film blends sound design, real-life insights, and expert perspectives to showcase Gaddi wool’s versatility in modern fashion, from streetwear to free-size silhouettes. By leveraging social media’s influence, the documentary positions this craft for a mainstream resurgence, making a strong case for its relevance in contemporary fashion.

            <h2 class="proj-heading">Reflections</h2>
            <p class="proj-info">This project bridged heritage and modernity. Immersed in Gaddi artisans’ lives, I witnessed their quiet resilience—craft as survival. Synthetic fakes sparked urgency: How to value “slow” in a “fast” world? Raw moments—calloused hands, clattering looms—taught me authenticity isn’t staged; it’s unearthed by listening, not filming.
            </p>
            <h2 class="proj-heading">Challenges</h2>
            <p class="proj-info">The rugged terrain of Naggar tested our teams limits—batteries dying in sub-zero temperatures, wind drowning out interviews, and gaining trust in communities wary of outsiders exploiting their stories. Balancing rawness with a narrative tightrope for Gen Z audiences was tricky. How do we avoid romanticizing poverty while celebrating craft? Editing became an emotional battleground: cutting poignant scenes to keep pacing sharp felt like losing pieces of their souls. The biggest hurdle? Translating “sustainability” from a buzzword into a visceral feeling—making viewers care beyond a hashtag.</p>
            <h2 class="proj-heading">Key Takeaway</h2>
            <p class="proj-info">Trust is the first draft: Relationships matter more than shots. Without the artisans’ vulnerability, the film would lack its heartbeat.
                Imperfection tells truth: Flawed audio, shaky frames—these “mistakes” became the film’s texture, mirroring the craft’s handmade essence.
                Storytelling is activism: Data (government certifications, thermal science) validates, but emotion mobilizes. A single artisan’s pride can outshine a thousand statistics.
                The future is hybrid: Tradition thrives when woven into contemporary contexts—like Gaddi wool reimagined as streetwear.</p>
